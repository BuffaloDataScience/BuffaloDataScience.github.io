[Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) was discussed at a fundamental mathematical level, with accompanying toy example on the [Worcester Heart Attack Study data](https://www.umass.edu/statdata/statdata/data/whas500.xls, https://www.umass.edu/statdata/statdata/data/). 

Code examples were demonstrated in Python. ....


And translated into R. ....

#### Application

If we have time, weâ€™ll finish up with data-storytelling applications of how we could use data tidying skills to improve our survival analysis thru feature generation.
