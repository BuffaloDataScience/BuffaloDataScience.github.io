[Tidy Data visual by Garrett Grolemund](http://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/)
 
demo-ed/discussed the tidy data principle by Hadley Wickham. Tidy Data has been massively influential idea in data science since 80% of our time is spent tidying up messy data. 

Tidy data principles worked out 
 - [in R](https://t.co/xlT1HO5QAp)  and 
 - Python ([1](https://github.com/jfpuget/Tidy-Data/blob/master/Tidy-Data.ipynb), [2](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Tidy_Data_In_Python?lang=en)) 

Here’s some cheat sheets [for R](https://t.co/0SutUCIRyx)  and [Python](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/infographics-final.jpg) (its really tall and skinny). 

For reference: Hadley’s 3 main R packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 are the cornerstone of modern exploratory data analysis in R. The equivalent in Python is pandas by Wes McKinney (like dplyr and tidyr) and matplotlib. If you don’t know these packages, they’ve made on boarding in either language much easier. You should give them a try over at Datacamp.com, which has some really excellent free and paid tutorials in R and (now) Python. Datacamp.com's  an interactive platform like Codecademy that gives feedback on your code in the browser, so its super helpful.



#### Application

Following the survival analysis presentation: we finished up with data-storytelling applications of how we could use data tidying skills to improve our survival analysis thru feature generation.
